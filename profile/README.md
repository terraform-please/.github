# Terraform Modules by terraform-please 🚀

Welcome to the terraform-please organization! Here, we maintain repositories that provide one-to-one conversions of popular Kubernetes
applications from kubectl manifests to native HCL format for use with Terraform/OpenTofu/CDKTF. This enables you to manage your Kubernetes 
resources alongside the rest of your infrastructure using Terraform.
